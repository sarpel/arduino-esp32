## Implementation Strategy

### Incremental Approach
1. **Implement by priority** (not by phase number)
2. **Compile and test** after each component
3. **Commit frequently** with descriptive messages
4. **Memory check** after each major component
5. **Integration test** after each priority tier

### Quality Gates
Each component must pass before proceeding:
- ✅ Zero compilation errors/warnings
- ✅ Component unit tests passing
- ✅ Memory usage within budget
- ✅ No performance regression
- ✅ Integration tests passing

### Risk Mitigation
- **Feature flags** for easy rollback
- **Incremental testing** prevents cascading issues
- **Memory profiling** at each step
- **Documentation** updated as we go
- **Commit history** allows easy reversion

## Notes

- **C++11 Compatibility:** No std::make_unique, manual unique_ptr allocation
- **Arduino Framework:** INPUT/OUTPUT macro conflicts, use custom enums
- **PlatformIO:** Build system requires careful header management
- **Memory Constraints:** ESP32 has 320KB RAM total, currently using ~32KB
- **Flash Constraints:** 4MB Flash, currently 59% used (~1.6MB available)
