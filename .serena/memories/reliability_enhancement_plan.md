# Reliability Enhancement Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis
**Completed (Phase 1 Foundation):**
- NetworkQualityMonitor (fully implemented)
- AdaptiveReconnection (fully implemented)
- ConnectionPool (exists, needs verification)
- NetworkManager (exists, needs verification)
- Configuration constants added to src/config.h

**Found Existing:**
- src/monitoring/HealthMonitor.h/cpp (exists but incomplete)

## Execution Strategy
171 tasks organized into 5 major phases:

### Phase 1 Remaining (10 tasks):
1. Network switching logic implementation
2. Audio buffer management during switch
3. State preservation during transition
4. Unit tests (WiFi, NetworkQuality, AdaptiveReconnection)
5. Integration tests with network simulation
6. Memory validation
7. 24-hour stability test
8. Documentation

### Phase 2: Health Monitoring (35+ tasks)
- Complete HealthMonitor with component-level scoring
- ComponentHealth scorers (Network, Memory, Audio, System)
- TrendAnalyzer with 60s sliding window
- PredictiveDetector for anomaly detection
- Health check framework
- Diagnostics integration
- Phase 2 validation

### Phase 3: Failure Recovery (38+ tasks)
- CircuitBreaker (3-state pattern)
- DegradationManager (4 modes)
- StateSerializer (TLV format with CRC)
- AutoRecovery with recovery strategies
- Crash recovery and self-healing
- Phase 3 validation

### Phase 4: Observability (32+ tasks)
- TelemetryCollector (1KB circular buffer)
- MetricsTracker (KPIs)
- Enhanced diagnostics interface
- Critical event logging
- Metrics integration
- Phase 4 validation

### Phase 5: Final Integration (36+ tasks)
- End-to-end testing
- Performance validation
- Documentation updates
- Configuration management
- Final validation criteria

## Constraints
- C++11 compatibility
- No std::make_unique
- Arduino framework macros (INPUT, OUTPUT conflicts)
- Memory budget: ~12KB additional RAM
- Flash budget: ~45KB code
- CPU overhead: <5%

## Implementation Approach
1. Verify existing implementations
2. Complete Phase 1 remaining tasks
3. Implement Phase 2-4 components systematically
4. Maintain compilation success at each checkpoint
5. Create comprehensive commits after each phase
