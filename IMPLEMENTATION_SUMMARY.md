**Date**: October 20, 2025
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Branch**: main (commit: 0c9f56b)

---

## Overview

Successfully implemented 8 high-priority improvements from the improvements_plan.md, focusing on code quality, reliability, and comprehensive documentation.

---

## Improvements Implemented

### ✅ Task 1.1: Config Validation System (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Files:**
- `src/config_validator.h` (NEW - 348 lines)
- `src/main.cpp` (MODIFIED - Added validation call)

**Features:**
- Runtime configuration validation at startup
- Validates WiFi SSID/password, server host/port
- Validates I2S parameters, timing intervals, memory thresholds
- Validates watchdog timeout compatibility
- Clear error messages for misconfigured values
- Prevents system from starting with invalid config

**Impact:** Prevents runtime failures from misconfiguration

---

### ✅ Task 1.2: Error Handling Documentation (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Files:**
- `ERROR_HANDLING.md` (NEW - ~400 lines)

**Contents:**
- System states and transitions diagram
- Error classification (critical vs non-critical)
- 8+ error recovery flows with flowcharts
- Watchdog timer behavior and configuration
- Error metrics and statistics tracking
- Debugging tips and common issues
- Future enhancement ideas

**Impact:** Comprehensive reference for developers and maintainers

---

### ✅ Task 1.3: Eliminate Magic Numbers (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Files:**
- `src/config.h` (MODIFIED - Added 12 new constants)

**New Constants:**
```cpp
SERIAL_INIT_DELAY = 1000 ms
GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN_DELAY = 100 ms
ERROR_RECOVERY_DELAY = 5000 ms
TASK_YIELD_DELAY = 1 ms
TCP_KEEPALIVE_IDLE = 5 sec
TCP_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL = 5 sec
TCP_KEEPALIVE_COUNT = 3
LOGGER_BUFFER_SIZE = 256 bytes
WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_SEC = 10 sec
TASK_PRIORITY_HIGH = 5
TASK_PRIORITY_NORMAL = 3
TASK_PRIORITY_LOW = 1
STATE_CHANGE_DEBOUNCE = 100 ms
```

**Updated Files:**
- `src/main.cpp` - Replaced 5 hardcoded delays with config constants

**Impact:** Improved maintainability and configuration flexibility

---

### ✅ Task 2.1: Watchdog Configuration Validation (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Files:**
- `src/config_validator.h` (MODIFIED - Added watchdog validation)

**Validations:**
- Ensures WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT_SEC > 0
- Warns if timeout is very short (< 5 sec)
- Verifies watchdog doesn't conflict with WiFi timeout
- Verifies watchdog doesn't conflict with error recovery delay
- Flags critical issues that prevent startup

**Impact:** Prevents false restarts from timeout conflicts

---

### ✅ Task 2.4: Memory Leak Detection (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Files:**
- `src/main.cpp` (MODIFIED - Enhanced SystemStats struct)

**New Tracking:**
- `peak_heap` - Highest memory value since startup
- `min_heap` - Lowest memory value reached
- `heap_trend` - Detects if memory is increasing/decreasing/stable
- `updateMemoryStats()` - Updates memory statistics periodically
- Leak detection warning when memory trends downward

**Integration:**
- `checkMemoryHealth()` calls updateMemoryStats()
- `printStats()` outputs comprehensive memory report
- Warns on potential memory leaks

**Example Output:**
```
--- Memory Statistics ---
Current heap: 65536 bytes
Peak heap: 327680 bytes
Min heap: 30720 bytes
Heap range: 297000 bytes
Memory trend: DECREASING (potential leak)
```

**Impact:** Early detection of memory leaks before critical failure

---

### ✅ Task 4.1: Extended Statistics (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Files:**
- `src/main.cpp` (MODIFIED - Enhanced stats output)

**New Metrics:**
- Peak heap usage since startup
- Minimum free heap (lowest point reached)
- Heap range (used/available)
- Memory trend detection
- All printed every 5 minutes to Serial

**Statistics Output:**
```
=== System Statistics ===
Uptime: 3600 seconds (1.0 hours)
Data sent: 1048576 bytes (1.00 MB)
WiFi reconnects: 2
Server reconnects: 1
I2S errors: 0
TCP errors: 0
--- Memory Statistics ---
Current heap: 65536 bytes
Peak heap: 327680 bytes
Min heap: 30720 bytes
Heap range: 297000 bytes
Memory trend: STABLE
========================
```

**Impact:** Better system visibility for monitoring and debugging

---

**Impact:** Easier setup and configuration for users

---

### ✅ Task 7.3: Troubleshooting Guide (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Files:**

**Covers:**
- Startup issues (30+ solutions)
- WiFi connection problems
- Server connection failures
- Audio/I2S issues
