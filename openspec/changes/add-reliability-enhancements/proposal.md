# Reliability Enhancements for ESP32 Audio Streamer

## Why

The ESP32 Audio Streamer currently achieves 100% compilation success and has a solid foundation with basic error handling through state machine recovery and exponential backoff. However, to achieve production-grade reliability targeting 99.5% uptime, the system needs advanced failure detection, prevention, and recovery mechanisms.

Current limitations:
- Single WiFi network support creates single point of failure
- Reactive error handling only (no predictive failure detection)
- No protection against cascading failures
- Limited visibility into system health and failure patterns
- Manual recovery required for many failure scenarios
- No persistent state to survive crashes

## What Changes

This change adds four foundational reliability capabilities to the ESP32 Audio Streamer:

### 1. Network Resilience
- Multi-WiFi support with automatic failover (2-5 networks with priority ordering)
- Network quality monitoring (RSSI, packet loss, RTT tracking)
- Connection pool management (primary + backup TCP connections)
- Adaptive reconnection strategies based on failure patterns
- Automatic network switching within 5 seconds of failure detection

### 2. Health Monitoring
- Comprehensive health scoring system (0-100%) computed every 10 seconds
- Component-level health tracking (network 40%, memory 30%, audio 20%, system 10%)
- Predictive failure detection (90% accuracy, 30s advance warning)
- Trend analysis using 60-second sliding window for anomaly detection
- Pluggable health check framework for extensibility

### 3. Failure Recovery
- Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
- Automatic degradation modes (NORMAL → REDUCED_QUALITY → SAFE_MODE → RECOVERY)
- State persistence to EEPROM/Flash for crash recovery
- Self-healing mechanisms with automatic recovery from 95% of failures within 60s
- Safe mode activation after 3 consecutive failures

### 4. Observability
- Telemetry collection with 1KB circular buffer (~50 events)
- Performance metrics tracking (uptime, errors, latency, throughput)
- Enhanced diagnostics interface via serial commands
- Critical event logging with timestamps and failure context

**Target Metrics:**
- 99.5% uptime (max 43.2 minutes downtime per month)
- <60s recovery time for network failures
- <120s recovery time for system failures
- 90% failure prediction accuracy
- <5% memory variance over 24 hours

**Resource Impact:**
- RAM: ~12KB additional (well within 320KB total)
- Flash: ~45KB additional code (~1.6MB available)
- CPU: <5% overhead for monitoring tasks
- No breaking changes to existing APIs or configuration

## Impact

**Affected Specifications:**
- NEW: `specs/network-resilience/spec.md` - Multi-WiFi and connection management
- NEW: `specs/health-monitoring/spec.md` - Health scoring and predictive detection
- NEW: `specs/failure-recovery/spec.md` - Circuit breaker and degradation modes
- NEW: `specs/observability/spec.md` - Telemetry and diagnostics

**Affected Code:**
- `src/network/` - New MultiWiFiManager, NetworkQualityMonitor, ConnectionPool classes
- `src/monitoring/` - New HealthMonitor, TrendAnalyzer, PredictiveDetector classes
- `src/core/` - New CircuitBreaker, StateSerializer, AutoRecovery classes
- `src/utils/` - New TelemetryCollector, MetricsTracker, DiagnosticsInterface classes
- `src/config.h` - New configuration constants for reliability features
- `platformio.ini` - No new library dependencies required

**Migration Plan:**
- All changes are additive and backward compatible
- Existing state machine and error handling remain functional
- Features can be enabled incrementally via configuration flags
- Default configuration maintains current behavior
- Phased rollout over 4 implementation phases (7-9 weeks total)

**Benefits:**
- Production-ready reliability for commercial deployment
- Reduced manual intervention through self-healing
- Better visibility into system health and failure patterns
- Graceful degradation under adverse conditions
- Foundation for future advanced features (cloud monitoring, remote diagnostics)

**Risks:**
- Medium: RAM constraints require careful implementation and testing
  - **Mitigation**: Incremental implementation, extensive memory testing at each phase
- Low: Complexity increase in system architecture
  - **Mitigation**: Modular design maintains separation of concerns
- Low: Performance overhead from monitoring
  - **Mitigation**: <5% CPU overhead validated through profiling
