# Health Monitoring Specification

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: System Health Scoring
The system SHALL compute a composite health score (0-100%) every 10 seconds based on weighted component health metrics to provide unified health assessment.

#### Scenario: Compute composite health score
- **WHEN** health monitoring cycle executes (every 10 seconds)

- **AND** system normalizes component scores to 0-100% range
- **AND** system publishes composite health score via EventBus

#### Scenario: Healthy system baseline
- **WHEN** all components operating normally (WiFi connected, memory stable, audio streaming, no errors)
- **THEN** network health score is 90-100% (RSSI > -70 dBm, packet loss < 1%)
- **AND** memory health score is 90-100% (free heap > 200KB, <5% fragmentation)
- **AND** audio health score is 90-100% (I2S errors < 1 per hour, no buffer underruns)
- **AND** system health score is 90-100% (uptime > 1 hour, CPU < 60%, temp < 70°C)
- **AND** composite health score is 90-100%

#### Scenario: Degraded health conditions
- **WHEN** network quality degrades (RSSI -75 to -80 dBm, packet loss 2-4%)
- **THEN** network health score drops to 60-80%
- **AND** composite health score reflects weighted impact (network is 40% of total)
- **AND** system publishes health degradation warning event

### Requirement: Component Health Tracking
The system SHALL independently track health metrics for network, memory, audio, and system components with component-specific scoring algorithms.

#### Scenario: Network component health
- **WHEN** evaluating network health

- **AND** system measures packet loss rate (weight 30%)
- **AND** system measures connection stability (weight 20%)

#### Scenario: Memory component health
- **WHEN** evaluating memory health
- **THEN** system measures free heap percentage (weight 60%)
- **AND** system measures heap fragmentation level (weight 30%)
- **AND** system tracks memory allocation failures (weight 10%)

#### Scenario: Audio component health
- **WHEN** evaluating audio health
- **THEN** system counts I2S read errors (weight 50%)
- **AND** system detects buffer underrun events (weight 30%)
- **AND** system measures audio quality degradation (weight 20%)
- **AND** system computes audio score: 100% at zero errors, 0% at >10 errors per minute

### Requirement: Predictive Failure Detection
The system SHALL analyze health metric trends over time to predict potential failures 30 seconds in advance with 90% accuracy, enabling proactive recovery actions.

#### Scenario: Detect degrading trend
- **WHEN** health score decreases by >20% over 60-second window
- **THEN** system computes trend slope using linear regression
- **AND** system predicts time-to-failure by extrapolating trend
- **AND** system publishes predictive failure warning when time-to-failure < 30 seconds

#### Scenario: Predict network disconnection
- **WHEN** RSSI declining at rate of -5 dBm per 10 seconds
- **AND** current RSSI is -70 dBm (disconnection threshold is -85 dBm)
- **THEN** system predicts disconnection in ~30 seconds
- **AND** system triggers preemptive network failover
- **AND** system logs prediction accuracy for algorithm tuning

#### Scenario: Predict memory exhaustion
- **WHEN** free heap decreasing at rate of 10KB per 60 seconds
- **AND** current free heap is 80KB (critical threshold is 20KB)
- **THEN** system predicts memory exhaustion in ~6 minutes
- **AND** system triggers memory cleanup and garbage collection
- **AND** system enters REDUCED_QUALITY degradation mode to conserve memory

### Requirement: Trend Analysis
The system SHALL maintain a 60-second sliding window of health metrics and perform statistical analysis to identify anomalies and predict failure conditions.

#### Scenario: Maintain sliding window
- **WHEN** new health measurement is available (every 10 seconds)
- **THEN** system stores measurement in circular buffer (6 samples for 60s window)
- **AND** system evicts oldest measurement when buffer is full
- **AND** system computes running statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max)

#### Scenario: Detect anomaly in metrics
- **WHEN** current measurement deviates >2 standard deviations from mean
- **THEN** system flags measurement as anomaly
- **AND** system requires 2 consecutive anomalies to trigger alert (reduce false positives)
- **AND** system publishes anomaly detection event with context

#### Scenario: Trend-based health prediction
- **WHEN** health score trend is computed every 60 seconds
- **THEN** system calculates slope and confidence interval
- **AND** system predicts health score in next 30 seconds using linear extrapolation
- **AND** system publishes prediction confidence level (0-100%)

### Requirement: Pluggable Health Check Framework
The system SHALL provide an extensible framework for registering custom health checks that can be added without modifying core health monitoring code.

#### Scenario: Register custom health check
- **WHEN** developer creates new health check component
- **THEN** component implements standard HealthCheck interface (execute(), getScore(), getMetrics())
- **AND** component registers with HealthMonitor during initialization
- **AND** HealthMonitor automatically includes component in health score computation

#### Scenario: Execute health checks periodically
- **WHEN** health monitoring cycle executes
- **THEN** system iterates over all registered health checks
- **AND** system calls execute() method on each health check
- **AND** system collects scores and metrics from all checks
- **AND** system computes composite score using configured weights

#### Scenario: Dynamic health check enable/disable
- **WHEN** user issues diagnostic command to disable specific health check
- **THEN** system marks health check as inactive without unregistering
- **AND** system excludes inactive checks from composite score computation
- **AND** system redistributes weights among active checks to maintain 100% total
